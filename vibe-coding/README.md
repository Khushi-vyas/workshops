# Introduction to Vibe Coding

In this workshop, we'll look at different tools for AI-assisted development

In particular, we'll cover

- Chat applications
- Coding assistants and IDEs
- Project bootstrapers
- Agents

We will build the Snake game (with JavaScript and React) as an example.
You don't need to know React to take part in this workshop.


# Chat Applications

- [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/)
- [Claude](https://claude.ai/)
- [DeepSeek](https://www.deepseek.com/en)
- [Ernie](https://ernie.baidu.com/)
- [Microsoft Copilot](https://copilot.microsoft.com/) (not to be confused with Github Copilot)

Prompt: "implement snake in react"


Helpful, but not convenient for development - require moving back-and-forth
between the chat application and the IDE



# Coding Assistants
